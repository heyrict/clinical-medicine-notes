# Surgical Anatomy of the brain
## Arterial Relationships
1. Middle cerebral artery (MCA)
    - Sphenoidal segment (M1): internal carotid artery (ICA) to limen insulae
    - Insular segment (M2): limen insulae to superior and inferior circular sulcus of the insula
    - Opercular segment (M3): runs in opercular compartment
    - Cortical segment (M4): sylvian fissure to the lateral surface of the cerebrum
    - Sylvian point (M point): loop of the most posterior M3 segment branch that exits from the sylvian fissure

1. Posterior cerebral artery (PCA)
    - P1: Basilar bifurcation to the site where PCom joins the PCA
    - P2: PCom to the posterior aspect of the midbrain
        - P2A: begins at the PCom and courses around the crus cerebri, inferior to optic tract
        - P2P: posterior margin of the crus cerebri to tegmentum of the midbrain within the ambient cistern
    - P3: under the posterior part of the pulvinar in the lateral aspect of the quadrigeminal cistern to the anterior limit of the anterior calcarine sulcus
        - The calcarine artery
        - The pareto-occipital artery
    - P4: cortical branches of the PCA

1. Anterior cerebral artery (ACA)
    - A1: bifurcation of the ICA to ACom
    - A2: ACom to the junction between rostrum and the genu of the cornus callosum
    - A3: the genu of the cornus callosum to the point where artery turns sharply
    - A4, A5: extend from the genu to the splenium

1. Medial surface
    - Inner layer: corpus callosum
    - Intermediate layer: Cingulate gyrus
    - Outer layer
        - Paracentral lobule
        - Paracentral ramus
        - Paracentral lobule
            - voluntary control of contralateral lower limb and perineal region
            - defecation and micturition
        - Marginal ramus

1. Brainstem
    - Midbrain
        - Anterior: the crus cerebri (or basis pedunculi)
        - Intermediate: the tegmentum
        - Posterior: the tectum
    - Pons (protuberance) groove
    - Medulla

# Cerebral Edema
1. Classifications
    - cytotoxic: secondary to cell injury
    - vasogenic: vascular leakage through a disrupted BBB
    - interstitial: secondary to hydrocephalus
    - osmotic

1. MRI representations
    - vasogenic edema
        - T1: Hypodense
        - T2, FLAIR: dexamethasone
    - cytotoxic edema
        - ~ 12 hrs: Loss of visible gray-white junction and gyral edema
        - 12 ~ 24 hrs: hyperintensity in T2
        - Sensitive to DWI: hyperintense
        - Acute infarction: low ADC

1. Treatment
    - diversion of spinal fluid: interstitial edema
    - reverse the cause: cytotoxic, interstitial and ostomic edema
    - glucocorticoids
        - improve symptoms in vasogenic edema esp. patients with brain tumors
    - diuretics: limited effect in time and efficacy
    - carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide: decreases CSF production: modest efficacy
    - osmotic agents: a temporary measure to provide time for the initiation for definitive treatment to eliminate the cause
    - mannitol or hypertonic saline: vasoconstriction, enhanced cerebral blood flow, altered rheology, alter the content of edema


# Physiology of the Cerebrospinal Fluid and Intracranial Pressure
Notes: 1 mmHg = 13.6 mmH₂O

1. Usual range: 5 - 10 mmHg, upper limit of 15 mmHg

1. Signs of elevated ICP
    - Vomiting without associated nausea
    - Papilledema: good specificity, observer dependent sensitivity
    - The Cushing response
        - Arterial hypertension: Pressure on the brainstem
        - Bradycardia: Pressure on vagus nerve
    - Respiration abnormality
        - Cheyne-Stokes respiration: Damage to the diencephalic region
        - Sustained hyperventilation: Dysfunction of the midbrain and upper pons
        - Ataxic respiration: Pontomedullary lesions
    - Herniation

1. Guidelines for ICP monitoring
    - GCS score of 3 to 8 + Abnormal CT
    - GCS score of 3 to 8 + Normal CT: 2 or more
        - Age: over 40 y/o
        - Unilateral Motor posturing
        - Systolic BP below 90 mmHg
    - GCS score of greater than 8 + Significant mass lesions in CT

1. Intracranial Pressure management
    - CSF
        - Ventriculostomy
        - Ventriculosubgaleal shunt
        - Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
        - Ventriculoatrial shunt
        - Third ventriculostomy
        - Meditations
            - Acetazolamide
                - most frequently used
                - has vasodilator effect, which may transiently worsen intracranial hypertension
                - **contraindicated in patients with closed head injury**
            - Furosemide
            - Corticosteroids
    - Blood: Reduce Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV)
        - Moderate hyperventilation (32 - 35 torr), tapered when discontinued
        - Elevation of the head (30 - 60 deg.), without rotation of the head or flexion of the neck
        - Increasing the clearance of edema
        - Hypothermia
    - Other: removal

1. Drugs
    - Steroids
        - Treatment of edema with brain tumors
        - No definite benefits seen in patients with head injury
        - Worsen outcome in cerebral ischemia
    - Barbiturates: pentobarbital is more effective
        - Appropriate for patients in whom conventional measures to control ICP have failed
        - Effective in situations where Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) is greater than metabolism
        - Usage
            - pentobarbital 5 - 10 mg/kg in 30 minutes
            - followed by continuous hourly maintenance infusion of 1 - 5 mg/kg
            - if hypotension occurs, apply volume expansion and dopamine anticonvulsant
    - Osmotic diuretics
        - Widely used to treat both vasogenic and cytotoxic edema
        - Transiently increase CBF independent of effect on ICP
        - **maybe contraindicated in patients with hyperemia and increased CBV**
    - Mannitol (20% Solution)
        - Rapid effect on ICP
        - Dose: 250 - 1000 mg/kg
    - Loop diuretics
        - Often used in conjunction with mannitol
        - Most appropriate in patients with fluid overload
        - Do not contribute greatly to lowering of ICP in the acute setting
